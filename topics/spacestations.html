        <p> They are spacecraft that orbit the Earth and allow space-bound astronauts to conduct space exploration and various experiments.
            The largest is the International Space Station (ISS).
            It belongs to sixteen countries and is about the size of a football field.
            It completes its orbit around the Earth in 90 minutes.

          <h4>Salyut 1</h4>
          <p>Salyut 1, was the world's first space station. It was launched into low Earth orbit by the Soviet Union on April 19, 1971.
            The Salyut program subsequently achieved five more successful launches of seven additional stations. 
            The program's final module, Zvezda (DOS-8), is still in orbit today.</p>

          <p>The International Space Station (ISS) is a large space station that was assembled and is maintained in low Earth orbit by a collaboration of five space agencies and their contractors
             It is the largest ever created space station in history.</p>

          <p>Mir (Russian: Мир) was a space station operated in low Earth orbit from 1986 to 2001,
             first by the Soviet Union and later by the Russian Federation. Mir was the first modular space station and was assembled in orbit from 1986 to 1996.
             It had a greater mass than any previous spacecraft. At the time it was the largest artificial satellite in orbit.</p>
